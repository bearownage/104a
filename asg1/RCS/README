We modified cppstrtok.cpp, string_set.cpp, string_set.h, Makefile from the 104a website as provided by Professor Mackey. Out program outputs a .str version of the .oc file that gets read into the 'oc' program.

|        2  This program was completed using pair programming.        |
|        3  Partner:  Husain Adam Askari (haskari@ucsc.edu)           |
|        4  Partner:  Vineet Ramareddi (vramared@ucsc.edu             |
|        5                                                            |
|        6  We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
|        7  drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
|        8  at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
|        9  be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
|       10  must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work   |
|       11  together, learning from each other, not to divide the work|into
|       12  two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.|

|       14  Husain Adam Askari spent       1 hours working alone.     |
|       15  Vineet Ramareddi spent 1 hours working alone.             |
|       16  We spent              2 hours working together.           |
|       17  Husain Adam Askari spent       1 hours driving.           |
|       18  Vineet Ramareddi spent 1 hours driving.                   |
